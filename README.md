## Steps Performed
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyzed the structure and distribution of data.
Checked for missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

2. Data Visualization:

Created histograms, box plots, and pair plots to explore distributions.
Analyzed relationships and patterns in the features.

3. Data Preprocessing:

Handled missing values using imputation techniques.
Encoded categorical variables using one-hot encoding.
Scaled numerical features using standardization or normalization.
Addressed data imbalance through resampling techniques.

4.Random Forest Model Implementation:

Split data into training and testing sets.
Trained a Random Forest Classifier using Scikit-learn.
Evaluated the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

5. Bagging and Boosting:

Applied Bagging (e.g., using Random Forest as a base model).
Implemented Boosting techniques (e.g., Gradient Boosting, XGBoost).
Compared results to analyze performance differences.

## Results and Insights
* Key Findings:
* Random Forest achieved high accuracy for glass type classification.
* Bagging improved model stability, while Boosting enhanced performance by focusing on hard-to-classify instances.
